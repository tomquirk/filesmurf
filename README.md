# File Smurf

### A Tiny Library for Batch File Renaming/Moving in Go
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/smurfs/images/9/92/Handy_Comic_Book.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120920121205">

## Why?
I needed a super basic library that conditionally renamed files while walking the filesystem. File Smurf is perfect for when you need to group files for whatever reason.

## Usage
see `github.com/tomquirk/photosmurf` for now...

## Contributions
Please do, I'm a Go noob :joy:
